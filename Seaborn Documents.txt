1. shape(0)-rows
   shape(1)-columns
univariate:
distplot=bin shape-histogram Histogram=frequency and how many times repeated
40-45, 45-50,range
redline-density
Bivariate:
joint plot-xaxis-10th pass mark,yaxis-salary
plot-scatter plot and histogram with repect to x and y
use-jointplot
kind-hex-heatmap-large quantity referes dark color
light color-not repeatition
kde-kernel density estimation
pairplot-hue-differentiate gender
   diag-kind-histogram
   kde-kind-scatter
seaborn-itself take x,y axis
kde-ssc  vs ssc plot-not scatter ie same vs same-find patteren
strip plot:
categorical vs quantitative data got strip plot
swarm plot: similar to strip plot but the points are adjusted(along the categorical axis) so that they donot overlap
this gives a better representation of thedistribution of values,but it does not scale well to large number of observations.its also called beeswarm.its good compliment tobox or violin plot in cases where you want to show all observations along with some representationof the underlying distribution
Distribution plot: Violin plot-x axis -categorical ,y axis -quantitative
                   doesnot find gender only find Male candidate density peak separately
box plot-percentile concept-find Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 and IQR lesser higher range of outliers
point plot-represents an estimation of central tendency for numeric variable by the position of the dot and provides some indication of the uncertainity around that estimate using error bars
more useful for focusing comparision between different levels of one or more categorical variables
